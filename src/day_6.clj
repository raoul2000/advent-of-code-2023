;; First we'll have to parse input to create a list of integers pairs [t d];
;; - 't' : is the race duration time
;; - 'd' : is the current distance record
;;
;; For a given d and t we must find all x where x*(t - x) > d  with  0 < x < t
;; We must then count how many x where found for each pair, and multiply them all
;; 
;; First hings first : parsing the input
