;;;; part 1 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; We have several 'card', each now holding 2 list of numnber:
;; - a list of 'winning' numbers
;; - a list of 'played' numbers

;; For each card we have to find how many played numbers are also winning number
;; If we found n numbers, mark this card with value 2^(n-1)
;;
;; Then sum up all cards values found to get the solution of part 1.

;; As always our first job will be to turn puzzle input (provided as string)
;; into a data structure adapted to the solution we want to implement.

;; Clojure provides the clojure.set/intersection function that could be a good choice

;; However, it must be used with sets so we will assume that both 'winning' and 'played'
;; list of number, don't contain duplicate (which makes sense in the context of this puzzle story)

;; Ok, so first, parsing the data
