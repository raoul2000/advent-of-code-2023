;; we must explore an 'engine-schematic' which is provided as grid
;; in this grid we have numbers, characters '.' and symbols characters 
;; which are not digits nor character '.'

;; we must select in this grid, only number which are adjacent to a symbol 
;; and forget about the others. Then sum them up all together

;; I don't have any fancy idea to solve this pne (sorry)
;; The first idea is to browse the grid line by lines, and each time we 
;; find a digit, accumulate following digits on the same line : we have a number
; Then for each number find all the adjacent positions and search for a symbol 
;; in each one.
;; this means we need a way to navigate a 2 dimensions grid.

;; let's try than

;; First we need to represent the grid

;; ok ok, it seems we have everything we need to solve the first part of this puzzle

;; The ideao is the following:

;; - for each pos
;;     - if it is a digit
;;        | - store it in the current-number (concat)
;;        | - if no symbol has been found yet (symbol-found?)
;;        |    |  - search for a symbol in adjacent positions
;;        |    |  - if one is found
;;        |    |     |   set symbol-found to true
;;      else
;;        | - if there is a current-number and symbol-found
;;        |    |  - add this number to the list of valid parts
;;        | - reset current-number

;; now we need to recognize 'gear' which is the char '*'

(defn is-gear-char? [c]
  (= \* c))

;; Given position of a gear, we must explore all its adjacent positions
;; searching for all digits that is included in a 'part number'.
;; If we find EXACTLY 2 adjacent part number, multiply them and remember the
;; result. At the end, sum them all to get the puzzle solution.
;;
;; ok...
;;
;; So first we can simplify this by noting that any number adjacent to a
;; gear IS a part number. A gear is a special 'symbol' and any number adjacent
;; to a 'symbol' is a part number (by definition).
;;
;; ok, so ?
;; 
;; we already have from the part 1:
;; - a predicate to identify a digit : is-digit-char?
;; - a function to get all adjacent positions of a given position : adjacent-coords

;; We could use the part 1 solution and modify it so to store for each
;; part number we find, the position of all adjacent gears (and ignoring any number
;; not adjacent to a gear).
;; Then with this result, we could process gear positions and find all 
;; that appear exactly twice. Multiply those 2 adjacent part numbers and store the
;; result. At the end sum them all.
